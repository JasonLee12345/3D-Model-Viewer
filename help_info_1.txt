The state of the software after you open it:

1. The software has already initialized the shader program. 
This initial shader is using "Per Pixel Shading". 

2. It uses the Phong-Model of the pixel level rendering method as well. 

3. The lights are already initialized and enabled. 
After you cancel and disable the shader program, 
you can see the lighting condition of the overall scene. 

4. Three lights are already initailized. They are located 
at three locations: left, right, and in front of the objects.

5. Lights parameters are already initialized. And you can change the 
lighting attributes by yourself at the right side of the control panel.

6. The program is using a space ship model and its texture once you open it.

How to use:

1. Lighting conditions:

At the left side of the this window, you can see lots of parameters of 
the totally three lights. These attributes are all working completely 
to their relative lights. As the lights are already initialized, if you 
want to see the pure results after changing of the lighting condition, 
I recommend you to disable the Phong-Model Shading Method, and 
enabled the lights by clicking "EnableLighting" button. The condition 
of lights and material are controled by three main channels, ambient, 
diffuse, and specular. As the material nature, it also has components 
like shininess, elumination. Here, we just introduced the shininess. 
You can control these parameters by yourself by sliding these sliders 
and clicking the buttons. It's very easy for using.
